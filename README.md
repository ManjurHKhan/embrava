# ENDRAVA

## What we do

Endrava uses machine learning and computer vision algorithms to track your gaze, alerting you when you get drowsy, or start looking down at your phone. It then aggregates your gaze data into the cloud and uses DocuSign to create an initial agreement between you, the driver, your insurance provider, and your employer. Then your insurance provider and employer (a truck driving company, for example), can reward you for driving distraction-free. 

### OpenaCV and Front End can be found in frontend-microservice branch.
